#### Course Description 
This course will introduce trainees to concepts of climate change, nutrition, diet, food systems, remote sensing and planetary health and the descriptive application of these concepts. Part two of the course will look at linking these concepts and analysis of data.
The Remote Sensing and spatial analysis section seeks to provide theoretical concepts underpinning Remote Sensing applications related to Food Systems, Climate Change and Planetary Health. This include image pre-processing using open source software and basic spatial analysis using optical and thermal remotely sensed data. The section provides a basis for the advanced phase of the course on Food Systems, Climate Change and Planetary Health spatial analysis to be offered towards the end of 2023.
