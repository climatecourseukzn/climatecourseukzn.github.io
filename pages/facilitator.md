<p align="justify"> <img src="../figures/wafaie.jpeg" alt="wafaie" style="float:left; width:120px; height:120px; padding: 10px;"><span style="vertical-align:bottom"> Wafaie Fawzi’s research has generated significant new knowledge on the discovery and translation of interventions to enhance maternal and child health and human development, with emphasis on nutritional factors. His research includes the epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, childhood infections, and HIV, TB and malaria. He established the Nutrition and Global Health Program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, that addresses and documents existing gaps; advances the research agenda; and convenes multi-disciplinary partners. He also developed two implementation science initiatives to advance adolescent health in Africa and Asia, and the intersectoral integration of agriculture, nutrition and health in Ethiopia and Tanzania. He established the Africa Research, Implementation Science, and Education (ARISE) Network, a partnership of leading academic institutions in Africa, and the China Harvard Africa Network (CHAN) to advance cutting-edge training of public health leaders through South-South-North institutional partnerships. </span> Visit <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/wafaie-fawzi/"><span style="text-align:center">Prof. Wafaie's website</span></a> for more information about his work. </p> <br>

Ina leads a research group on climate change, nutrition and health with the ambition i) to define impacts on dietary habits and nutritional status, ii) to design, implement and evaluate climate change adaptation strategies, and iii) to determine the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation actions. Ina coordinates a large consortium on climate change and health in sub-Saharan Africa, and is Robert Bosch Junior Professor for Sustainable Nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. She has published more than 90 peer-reviewed articles, has an h-index of 23 and an i10-index of 45. Her work has been cited more than 2100 times. </span> Visit <a href="https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/en/personen/jun-prof-pd-dr-ina-danquah-7580"><span style="text-align:center">Prof. Danquah's website</span></a> for more information about his work. </p> <br>

<p align="justify"> <img src="../figures/IMadzorera Potrait.jpg" alt="IMadzorera Potrait" style="float:left; width:120px; height:120px;padding: 10px;"><span style="vertical-align:bottom"> Dr. Isabel Madzorera is an Assistant Professor in Public Health Nutrition at the University of California, Berkeley, in the division of Community Health Sciences. Dr. Madzorera is a nutrition epidemiologist with interests in the intersection of food systems, nutrition and sustainable diets in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The goals of her research program are to utilize advanced nutrition epidemiologic methods to assess diet quality as a key modifiable risk factor for poor maternal and child health outcomes in LMICs, and to identify the role of food systems and other contributing factors to the triple burden of malnutrition in these contexts. Dr. Madzorera has led global health research focusing on the evaluation of food systems and diet quality, and their influence on maternal and child health.  Her previous research has included evaluating the role of maternal diet quality during pregnancy and its impacts on the risk of low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births, and also assessing the effect of COVID-19 on food prices and diets. Dr. Madzorera has extensive field-based experience including leading maternal and child nutrition interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. She has spent considerable time working in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique and conducted research in Tanzania and Ethiopia. Dr. Madzorera has an ScD in Nutritional Epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health.  </span> Visit <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/isabel-madzorera/"><span style="text-align:center">Dr. Madzorera's website</span></a> for more information about her work. </p> <br>

His expertise are in vegetation pattern and condition analysis in the face of local and global change using remotely sensed datasets and approaches. He integrates ecology, biodiversity conservation and Remote sensing to model the impact of landscape transformation and invasive species on ecosystems. He is also interested in understanding the implication of urban green spaces on urban thermal micro- and macro climate in the face of climate change using optical and thermal remotely sensed data. His specific areas of interest include land use and land cover change, hyperspectral- and multi- spectral Remote Sensing of vegetation, urban green ecology in a changing global climate, quantification of urban ecosystem services using remotely sensed data and precision farming using hyper and multi-spectral data from aerial and satellite platforms. </span> Visit <a href="https://saees.ukzn.ac.za/John-Odindi/ "><span style="text-align:center">Prof. Odindi's website</span></a> for more information about his work. </p> <br>
